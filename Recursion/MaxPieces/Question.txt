given a rope of length n , you need to find the maximum number of pieces you can make such that the length of every piece is in 
set {a, b, c} for the given three values a, b, c

i/p: n = 5, a = 2, b = 5, c = 1
o/p: 5
i/p: n = 23, a = 12, b = 9, c = 11
o/p: 5
i/p: n = 5, a = 4, b = 2, c = 6
o/p: -1 (no solution is posssible so return -1)
